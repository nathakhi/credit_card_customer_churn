# credit_card_customer_churn
Our Â manager at a bank is concerned with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. He is willing to find out why this was occurring and who are more prone to get churned so that we can plan for how to improve the situation and retain customers.
## Goal
To predict customers more prone to getting churned based on the customer and the credit card consumption attributes.
## Objective
To identify the customers who are prone to leave and reduce the churning proportion to less than 10% within the next six months.
